                <p>
                    Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, are perhaps the most
                    common kind of complaint you get while you are still learning
                    Python:
                </p>
                <code>>>> while True print('Hello world') File "&lt;stdin>", line 1 while
                    True print('Hello world') ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax
                </code>
                <p>
                    The parser repeats the offending line and displays a little ‘arrow’
                    pointing at the earliest point in the line where the error was
                    detected. The error is caused by (or at least detected at) the token
                    preceding the arrow: in the example, the error is detected at the
                    function print(), since a colon (':') is missing before it. File
                    name and line number are printed so you know where to look in case
                    the input came from a script.
                </p>

            <article>
                <p>
                    Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may
                    cause an error when an attempt is made to execute it. Errors
                    detected during execution are called exceptions and are not
                    unconditionally fatal: you will soon learn how to handle them in
                    Python programs. Most exceptions are not handled by programs,
                    however, and result in error messages as shown here:
                </p>
                <code>>>> 10 * (1/0) Traceback (most recent call last): File
                    "&lt;stdin>", line 1, in &lt;module> ZeroDivisionError: division by
                    zero >>> 4 + spam*3 Traceback (most recent call last): File
                    "&lt;stdin>", line 1, in &lt;module> NameError: name 'spam' is not
                    defined >>> '2' + 2 Traceback (most recent call last): File
                    "&lt;stdin>", line 1, in &lt;module> TypeError: Can't convert 'int'
                    object to str implicitly
                </code>
                <p>
                    The last line of the error message indicates what happened.
                    Exceptions come in different types, and the type is printed as part
                    of the message: the types in the example are
                    <span>ZeroDivisionError</span>, <span>NameError</span> and
                    <span>TypeError</span>. The string printed as the exception type is
                    the name of the built-in exception that occurred. This is true for
                    all built-in exceptions, but need not be true for user-defined
                    exceptions (although it is a useful convention). Standard exception
                    names are built-in identifiers (not reserved keywords).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rest of the line provides detail based on the type of exception
                    and what caused it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The preceding part of the error message shows the context where the
                    exception occurred, in the form of a stack traceback. In general it
                    contains a stack traceback listing source lines; however, it will
                    not display lines read from standard input.

            <article>
                <p>
                    It is possible to write programs that handle selected exceptions.
                    Look at the following example, which asks the user for input until a
                    valid integer has been entered, but allows the user to interrupt the
                    program (using <span>Control-C</span> or whatever the operating
                    system supports); note that a user-generated interruption is
                    signalled by raising the <span>KeyboardInterrupt</span> exception.
                </p>
                <code>>>> while True: ... try: ... x = int(input("Please enter a number:
                    ")) ... break ... except ValueError: ... print("Oops! That was no
                    valid number. Try again...") ...
                </code>
                <p>The <span>try</span> statement works as follows.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            First, the <span>try</span> clause (the statement(s) between the
                            <span>try</span> and <span>except</span> keywords) is executed.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            If no exception occurs, the <span>except</span> clause is
                            skipped and execution of the <span>try</span> statement is
                            finished.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            If an exception occurs during execution of the try clause, the
                            rest of the clause is skipped. Then if its type matches the
                            exception named after the <span>except</span> keyword, the
                            except clause is executed, and then execution continues after
                            the <span>try</span> statement.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            If an exception occurs which does not match the exception named
                            in the except clause, it is passed on to outer
                            <span>try</span> statements; if no handler is found, it is an
                            <span><i>unhandled exception</i></span> and execution stops with
                            a message as shown above.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            If the <span>finally</span> clause executes a
                            <span>break</span>, <span>continue</span> or
                            <span>return</span> statement, exceptions are not re-raised.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    A <span>try</span> statement may have more than one except clause,
                    to specify handlers for different exceptions. At most one handler
                    will be executed. Handlers only handle exceptions that occur in the
                    corresponding try clause, not in other handlers of the same
                    <span>try</span> statement. An except clause may name multiple
                    exceptions as a parenthesized tuple, for example:
                </p>
                <code>... except (RuntimeError, TypeError, NameError): ... pass
                </code>
                <p>
                    A class in an <span>except</span> clause is compatible with an
                    exception if it is the same class or a base class thereof (but not
                    the other way around — an except clause listing a derived class is
                    not compatible with a base class). For example, the following code
                    will print B, C, D in that order:
                </p>
                <code>class B(Exception): pass class C(B): pass class D(C): pass for cls
                    in [B, C, D]: try: raise cls() except D: print("D") except C:
                    print("C") except B: print("B")
                </code>
                <p>
                    Note that if the <span>except</span> clauses were reversed (with
                    <span>except</span> B first), it would have printed B, B, B — the
                    first matching except clause is triggered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last except clause may omit the exception name(s), to serve as a
                    wildcard. Use this with extreme caution, since it is easy to mask a
                    real programming error in this way! It can also be used to print an
                    error message and then re-raise the exception (allowing a caller to
                    handle the exception as well):
                </p>
                <code>import sys try: f = open('myfile.txt') s = f.readline() i =
                    int(s.strip()) except OSError as err: print("OS error:
                    {0}".format(err)) except ValueError: print("Could not convert data
                    to an integer.") except: print("Unexpected error:",
                    sys.exc_info()[0]) raise</code>
                <p>
                    The <span>try … except</span> statement has an optional
                    <i>else clause</i>, which, when present, must follow all except
                    clauses. It is useful for code that must be executed if the try
                    clause does not raise an exception. For example:
                </p>
                <code>for arg in sys.argv[1:]: try: f = open(arg, 'r') except OSError:
                    print('cannot open', arg) else: print(arg, 'has',
                    len(f.readlines()), 'lines') f.close()</code>
                <p>
                    The use of the <span>else</span> clause is better than adding
                    additional code to the <span>try</span> clause because it avoids
                    accidentally catching an exception that wasn’t raised by the code
                    being protected by the <span>try … except</span> statement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When an exception occurs, it may have an associated value, also
                    known as the exception’s <i>argument</i>. The presence and type of
                    the argument depend on the exception type.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The except clause may specify a variable after the exception name.
                    The variable is bound to an exception instance with the arguments
                    stored in <span>instance.args</span>. For convenience, the exception
                    instance defines <span>__str__()</span> so the arguments can be
                    printed directly without having to reference <span>.args</span>. One
                    may also instantiate an exception first before raising it and add
                    any attributes to it as desired.
                </p>
                <code>>>> try: ... raise Exception('spam', 'eggs') ... except Exception
                    as inst: ... print(type(inst)) # the exception instance ...
                    print(inst.args) # arguments stored in .args ... print(inst) #
                    __str__ allows args to be printed directly, ... # but may be
                    overridden in exception subclasses ... x, y = inst.args # unpack
                    args ... print('x =', x) ... print('y =', y) ... &lt;class
                    'Exception'> ('spam', 'eggs') ('spam', 'eggs') x = spam y =
                    eggs</code>
                <p>
                    If an exception has arguments, they are printed as the last part
                    (‘detail’) of the message for unhandled exceptions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Exception handlers don’t just handle exceptions if they occur
                    immediately in the try clause, but also if they occur inside
                    functions that are called (even indirectly) in the try clause. For
                    example:
                </p>
                <code>>>> def this_fails(): ... x = 1/0 ... >>> try: ... this_fails() ...
                    except ZeroDivisionError as err: ... print('Handling run-time
                    error:', err) ... Handling run-time error: division by zero</code>

                <p>
                    The <span>raise</span> statement allows the programmer to force a
                    specified exception to occur. For example:
                </p>
                <code>>>> raise NameError('HiThere') Traceback (most recent call last):
                    File "&lt;stdin>", line 1, in &lt;module> NameError: HiThere</code>
                <p>
                    The sole argument to <span>raise</span> indicates the exception to
                    be raised. This must be either an exception instance or an exception
                    class (a class that derives from <span>Exception</span>). If an
                    exception class is passed, it will be implicitly instantiated by
                    calling its constructor with no arguments:
                </p>
                <code>raise ValueError # shorthand for 'raise ValueError()'</code>
                <p>
                    If you need to determine whether an exception was raised but don’t
                    intend to handle it, a simpler form of the
                    <span>raise</span> statement allows you to re-raise the exception:
                </p>
                <code>>>> try: ... raise NameError('HiThere') ... except NameError: ...
                    print('An exception flew by!') ... raise ... An exception flew by!
                    Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin>", line 2, in

                    Exception chaining happens automatically when an exception is raised
                    inside an <span>except</span> or <span>finally</span> section.
                    Exception chaining can be disabled by using
                    <span>from None</span> idiom:
                </p>
